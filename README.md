# Problem Statement  
Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India with a global presence, is seeking to enhance its data analytics capabilities. The management has observed a lack of sufficient insights for making swift, data-driven decisions. To address this, they plan to expand their data analytics team by recruiting several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, aims to find candidates proficient in both technical and interpersonal skills. To evaluate these abilities, he has organized a SQL challenge.

### Data Organized:
The dataset is taken from the AtliQ. Thanks to the AtliQ for providing datasets for public access which is a great learning asset - feel free to explore them here. This dataset contains only gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database and 1 text file (meta_data)


## 3. PROCESS  
### Tools Used:
1. MySQL
2. Power BI

### Data Used:
dim_customers, dim_product, fact_gross_price, fact_manufacturing_cost, fact_pre_invoice_deductions, fact_sales_monthly  

### About Data:  
This file provides a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data

5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.

Column Description for dim_customer table:
1. customer_code: The 'customer_code' column features unique identification codes for every customer in the dataset. These codes can be used to track a customer's sales history, demographic information, and other relevant details.
